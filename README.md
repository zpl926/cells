## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for **development** and testing purposes. See the [Deployment section below](#pre-built-binaries) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### A - Prerequisites

The following elements are required to compile and run Pydio Cells on your machine:

- Go language **v1.21** or higher and a [correctly configured](https://golang.org/doc/install#testing) Go toolchain,
- MySQL database 5.6 or higher (or MariaDB equivalent).

_Note: We have developed and tested Pydio Cells on macOS, Ubuntu, Debian and CentOS. Windows version might still have unknown glitches and is not yet supported._

### B - Build From Sources

Assuming that your system meets the above prerequisites, building the **Pydio Cells** backend from the source code is quite straightforward:

```sh
# Retrieve the code
git clone https://github.com/pydio/cells
# Enter cells directory
cd cells
# Build your binary
make dev
```

### C - Configure Environment

To have the environment running, you must also:

- Create a database in your chosen DB server,
- Run the Pydio Cells installer that will guide you through the necessary steps: you might refer to the [official documentation](https://pydio.com/en/docs/cells/v4/cells-installation) for additional information.


```sh
./cells configure
```

### D - Start Server

```sh
./cells start
```
Access the default site https://localhost:8080/ and you are good to go. Learn more about Cells features 
and advanced configuration in the [Documentation](https://pydio.com/en/docs).

## Running the tests

To run the tests, simply do

```sh
go test -v ./...
```

Please read the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) document if you wish to add more tests or contribute to the code.

## Pre-built Binaries

Binaries are currently provided for [Linux, macOS and Windows distributions](https://pydio.com/en/download). To deploy them on a live system, please see the [Installation Guide](https://pydio.com/en/docs/cells/v4/cells-installation) instructions.
